Gnome Sort in Python: A Simple but Efficient Sorting Algorithm


This project implements the gnome sort sorting algorithm in Python. Gnome sort is a simple sorting algorithm that is known to be efficient in practice. It works by repeatedly comparing the current element to the previous element and swapping them if they are in the wrong order. The motivation is to assess whether working with the ChatGPT open-source code in this context would produce a valid result in sorting an experiment using gnome sort.

Methods: The gnome sort algorithm was implemented in Python using the following steps:
- Initialize a list of numbers.
- Start at the beginning of the list.
- Compare the current element to the previous element.
- If the current element is less than the previous element, swap them.
- Move to the next element.
- Repeat steps 2-4 until the list is sorted.

# Results:
The ChatGPT model has been inconsistent in producing precise results, even after multiple attempts. The images below show the script working as expected in one run, but crashing in another.
